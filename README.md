# News Site

My project for week 2 at the Technigo Bootcamp - a newssite. 

## The problem

I did my website desktop first and then made it responsive for mobile and tablet. If I would have had more time I would have planned the project better and probably made it more advanced. 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
